Solomon Asch’s conformity experiments from the 1950s demonstrated that social pressure significantly influences individual judgment and behavior. Participants were asked to match line lengths while unknowingly surrounded by actors providing incorrect answers, resulting in 36.8% of subjects conforming to the erroneous group consensus. The research revealed that individuals often prioritize social acceptance over their own accurate perceptions. These findings have had lasting implications for understanding group dynamics, peer pressure, and collective decision-making processes.
