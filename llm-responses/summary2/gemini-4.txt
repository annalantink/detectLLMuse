Solomon Asch’s experiments revealed that approximately 36.8% of individuals will conform to an incorrect group consensus due to social pressure. By testing subjects against actors who gave wrong answers about line lengths, Asch demonstrated that the need for social acceptance often overrides personal perception. This work remains a critical benchmark for studying group dynamics and the psychological roots of conformity.
