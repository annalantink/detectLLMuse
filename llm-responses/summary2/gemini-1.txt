The Asch conformity experiments investigated how social pressure influences individual judgment by placing subjects in groups where actors intentionally gave incorrect answers regarding line lengths. Results indicated that over one-third of participants conformed to the group’s erroneous consensus despite the visual evidence to the contrary. These findings underscore the significant impact of social dynamics on decision-making and continue to inform psychological research on peer influence and group behavior.
