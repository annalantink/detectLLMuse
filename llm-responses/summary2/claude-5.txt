Solomon Asch wanted to understand how groups affect what we think and do, so he designed clever experiments in the 1950s using a simple line-matching task. The twist was that most people in the room were actors trained to give wrong answers, which put real participants in an awkward position. About 37% of people ended up going along with the group’s incorrect answer because fitting in felt more important than being right. This research helps explain why peer pressure works and why people sometimes make bad decisions in groups.
