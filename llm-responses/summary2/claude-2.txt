Back in the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch ran some pretty eye-opening experiments about how much we let others influence us. He had people match line lengths in groups where everyone else (secretly actors) gave wrong answers on purpose. Shockingly, over a third of participants went along with the wrong answer even though they knew better! It just goes to show how powerful the need to fit in can be, especially when it comes to things like peer pressure.
