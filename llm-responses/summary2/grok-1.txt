The Asch conformity experiments, conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s, demonstrated how social pressure compels individuals to conform to group consensus despite clear evidence to the contrary. Participants faced a task of matching line lengths, where confederates deliberately gave wrong answers, leading 36.8% of real subjects to align with the incorrect majority. This research underscores the potency of social dynamics in overriding personal judgment, with lasting implications for understanding peer pressure and group decision-making.
