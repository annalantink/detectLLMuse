The Asch conformity experiments showed how social pressure can make people go along with a group even when they believe the group is wrong. In a line-matching task where most “participants” were actually actors giving incorrect answers, about 36.8% of real subjects conformed to the false consensus. The results demonstrate how the need for acceptance can override personal judgment and help explain conformity in real-life group decisions.
