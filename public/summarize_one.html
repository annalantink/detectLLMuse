                    <h2>Task Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        You are being asked to participate in a research study about identifying characteristics of, and patterns in, 
                        the summarization of research abstracts. This assignment will take you approximately 20 minutes to complete. 
                        This study is being done by masters students from the TU Delft, and will be used for a project
                        for the Crowd Computing course provided by the university. Data collected from this assignment may be included in a report 
                        and presentation submitted for the course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this assignment, you will first read an example of an abstract and a valid summary.
                        Next, you will complete two abstract summarization tasks. For these, you will be provided an abstract,
                        which you should summarize in the text box below it. The abstracts are 120-170 words in length, and
                        the <b>summaries should be roughly 2-4 sentences in length.</b> You do not need expertise in any subject 
                        to complete these summarization tasks. Finally, you must complete a survey about your experience
                        writing the summaries. Once the survey is complete, you can click "Submit" and you will be redirected to Prolific.
                        On any page, this opening statement can be read by clicking the "?" button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please consider the following when completing this assignment:
                        <br><br>
                        Once you have completed a section, please do not go back to it. <b>Moving back to previous pages may
                        introduce bugs that will risk the completion of your assignment.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        For the best experience, <b>please complete this survey in your browser's full screen mode.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>You are allowed to use AI tools</b> (such as ChatGPT or similar) while completing this task. That said, 
                        the purpose of this study is to understand human reasoning and expression. For this reason, answers written 
                        mostly in your own words and ideas are much more valuable to us than answers that closely resemble typical AI outputs.
                        <br><br>
                        After writing two summaries and fully completing the survey, you will be financially compensated with a rate of 6£ per hour.            
                    </p>

                    <h2>Consent and Participant Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        To the best of our abilities, your data will be stored securely. We will collect and store the summaries you write, behavioral data that 
                        is tracked as you write, and your Prolific ID. The only personally identifying information that is stored will be your Prolific ID. 
                        The Prolific ID is stored exclusively for the quality management of the collected data, and will only be visible to the research team.
                        Data used for the Crowd Computing project will have the Prolific ID removed. The data will be stored in a database provided by Render.com.

            <p>
                For this page, we provide you an abstract for you to read. After reading the abstract, please summarize
                the abstract
                in the text box. Your summary should be 2-4 sentences in length. Once finished, click 'Next Page'. Note
                that the reference we
                include is not relevant for your summary, <b>only the provided abstract text should be summarized.</b>

                        This research provides evidence that people overestimate the extent to which their actions and
                        appearance
                        are noted by others, a phenomenon dubbed the spotlight effect. In Studies 1 and 2, participants
                        who were
                        asked to don a T-shirt depicting either a flattering or potentially embarrassing image
                        overestimated the
                        number of observers who would be able to recall what was pictured on the shirt. In Study 3,
                        participants
                        in a group discussion overestimated how prominent their positive and negative utterances were to
                        their
                        fellow discussants. Studies 4 and 5 provide evidence supporting an anchoring-and-adjustment
                        interpretation
                        of the spotlight effect. In particular, people appear to anchor on their own rich
                        phenomenological experience
                        and then adjust—insufficiently—to take into account the perspective of others. The discussion
                        focuses on the
                        manifestations and implications of the spotlight effect across a host of everyday social
                        phenomena.
