                            This research provides evidence that people overestimate the extent to which their actions and appearance 
                            are noted by others, a phenomenon dubbed the spotlight effect. In Studies 1 and 2, participants who were 
                            asked to don a T-shirt depicting either a flattering or potentially embarrassing image overestimated the 
                            number of observers who would be able to recall what was pictured on the shirt. In Study 3, participants 
                            in a group discussion overestimated how prominent their positive and negative utterances were to their 
                            fellow discussants. Studies 4 and 5 provide evidence supporting an anchoring-and-adjustment interpretation 
                            of the spotlight effect. In particular, people appear to anchor on their own rich phenomenological experience 
                            and then adjust—insufficiently—to take into account the perspective of others. The discussion focuses on the 
                            manifestations and implications of the spotlight effect across a host of everyday social phenomena.
