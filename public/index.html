            <h2>Task Description</h2>
            <p>
                You are being invited to participate in a research study that evaluates summaries of research abstracts.
                This study is being done by a research group consisting of masters students from the TU Delft. The
                purpose of
                this research study is about identifying characteristics of, and patterns in, the summarization of
                research abstracts.
                This assignment will take you approximately 15 minutes to complete. The data will be used for a project
                for the Crowd
                Computing course provided by the TU Delft, and will be included in a report and presentation submitted
                for the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this assignment, we ask you to first read an example of an abstract and its corresponding summary.
                Next, you will
                be asked to complete two abstract summarization tasks. For these tasks, you will be provided an abstract
                which you
                should summarize in the text box below it. The abstracts are approximately 120-170 words in length, and
                the <b>summaries should</b>
                <b>be roughly 2-4 sentences in length.</b> We provide the citation for each abstract as well, but the
                citations are not relevant for your summary.
                You do not need expertise in any subject to complete these summarization tasks. On the fifth and final
                page, you will be asked to
                complete a survey about your experience with writing the summaries. Once the survey is complete, you can
                click "Submit" and you will
                be redirected to Prolific.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that this interface does not have back buttons, and <b>we ask you to not go back to previous
                    pages when completing </b>
                <b>this assignment</b>. This opening statement can be read in later parts of the assignment by clicking
                the "?" button.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the best experience, <b>please complete this survey in your browser's full screen mode.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>You are allowed to use AI tools</b> (such as ChatGPT or similar) while completing this task. That
                said, the purpose of this
                study is to understand human reasoning and expression. For this reason, answers written mostly in your
                own words and ideas
                are much more valuable to us than answers that closely resemble typical AI outputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you complete this assignment, meaning you write a summary for each of the two provided abstracts, you
                will be financially compensated
                with XX$.
            </p>

            <p>
                As with any online activity the risk of a breach is always possible. To the best of our ability your
                answers in this study
                will remain confidential. We will minimize any risks by anonymizing the data that we collect. We will
                only store the summaries
                you write, and behavioral data that is tracked as you write the summaries (e.g. how long it takes to
                complete a summary, typing
                speed, etc.). None of the data will be personally identifying. Your Prolific ID will be tracked but not
                stored, to manage
                integration with the Prolific website. The data will be stored in a database provided by Render.com.

                anonymity of the data,
                your data <b>cannot</b> be removed once you have consented to participating.
