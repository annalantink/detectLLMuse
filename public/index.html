            <h1>Opening Statement</h1>
            <h2>Task Description</h2>
            <p>
                You are being invited to participate in a research study about identifying characteristics of, and
                patterns in,
                the summarization of research abstracts. This assignment will take you approximately 20 minutes to
                complete.
                This study is being done by masters students from the TU Delft, and will be used for a project
                for the Crowd Computing course provided by the university. Data collected from this assignment may be
                included in a report
                and presentation submitted for the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this assignment, you will first read an example of an abstract and a valid summary.
                Next, you will complete two abstract summarization tasks. For these, you will be provided an abstract,
                which you should summarize in the text box below it. The abstracts are 120-170 words in length, and
                the <b>summaries should be roughly 2-4 sentences in length.</b> You do not need expertise in any subject
                to complete these summarization tasks. Finally, you must complete a survey about your experience
                writing the summaries. Once the survey is complete, you can click "Submit" and you will be redirected to
                Prolific.
                On any page, this opening statement can be read by clicking the "?" button.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please consider the following when completing this assignment:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Once you have completed a section, please do not go back to it. <b>Moving back to previous pages may
                        introduce bugs that will risk the completion of your assignment.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the best experience, <b>please complete this survey in your browser's full screen mode.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>You are allowed to use AI tools</b> (such as ChatGPT or similar) while completing this task. That
                    said,
                    the purpose of this study is to understand human reasoning and expression. For this reason, answers
                    written
                    mostly in your own words and ideas are much more valuable to us than answers that closely resemble
                    typical AI outputs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After writing two summaries and fully completing the survey, you will be financially compensated
                    with a rate of 6£ per hour.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h2>Consent and Participant Information</h2>
            <p>
                To the best of our abilities, your data will be stored securely. We will collect and store the summaries
                you write, behavioral data that
                is tracked as you write, and your Prolific ID. The only personally identifying information that is
                stored will be your Prolific ID.
                The Prolific ID is stored exclusively for the quality management of the collected data, and will only be
                visible to the research team.
                Data used for the Crowd Computing project will have the Prolific ID removed. The data will be stored in
                a database provided by Render.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Once you click the "Next Page" button, you consent to participating in this research.</b> For
                logistical reasons,
                your data cannot be removed once you have consented to participating.
