                        <p> 
                            You are participating in a research study that evaluates summaries of research abstracts. 
                            This study is being done by a research group consisting of masters students from the TU Delft. The purpose of 
                            this research study is about identifying characteristics of, and patterns in, the summarization of research abstracts. 
                            This assignment will take you approximately 15 minutes to complete. The data will be used for a project for the Crowd 
                            Computing course provided by the TU Delft, and will be included in a report and presentation submitted for the course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this assignment, we ask you to first read an example of an abstract and its corresponding summary. Next, you will 
                            be asked to complete two abstract summarization tasks. For these tasks, you will be provided an abstract which you 
                            should summarize in the text box below it. The abstracts are approximately 120-170 words in length, and the <b>summaries should</b>
                            <b>be roughly 2-4 sentences in length.</b> You do not need expertise in any subject to complete these summarization tasks. On the fifth and
                            final page, you will be asked to complete a survey about your experience with writing the summaries. Once the survey is
                            complete, you can click "Submit" and you will be redirected to Prolific. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please note that this interface does not have back buttons, and <b>we ask you to not go back to previous pages when completing </b>
                            <b>this assignment</b>. This opening statement can be read in later parts of the assignment by clicking the "?" button.

                        <p>
                            <b>You are allowed to use AI tools</b> (such as ChatGPT or similar) while completing this task. That said, the purpose of this 
                            study is to understand human reasoning and expression. For this reason, answers written mostly in your own words and ideas 
                            are much more valuable to us than answers that closely resemble typical AI outputs.

                        <p>
                            If you complete this assignment, meaning you write a summary for each of the two provided abstracts, you will be financially compensated 
                            with XX$.

                            As with any online activity the risk of a breach is always possible. To the best of our ability your answers in this study 
                            will remain confidential. We will minimize any risks by anonymizing the data that we collect. We will only store the summaries 
                            you write, and behavioral data that is tracked as you write the summaries (e.g. how long it takes to complete a summary, typing 
                            speed, etc.). None of the data will be personally identifying. Your Prolific ID will be tracked but not stored, to manage 
                            integration with the Prolific website. The data will be stored in a database provided by Render.com.
