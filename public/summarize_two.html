                    <h2>Task Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        You are being asked to participate in a research study about identifying characteristics of, and
                        patterns in,
                        the summarization of research abstracts. This assignment will take you approximately 20 minutes
                        to complete.
                        This study is being done by masters students from the TU Delft, and will be used for a project
                        for the Crowd Computing course provided by the university. Data collected from this assignment
                        may be included in a report
                        and presentation submitted for the course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this assignment, you will first read an example of an abstract and a valid summary.
                        Next, you will complete two abstract summarization tasks. For these, you will be provided an
                        abstract,
                        which you should summarize in the text box below it. The abstracts are 120-170 words in length,
                        and
                        the <b>summaries should be roughly 2-4 sentences in length.</b> You do not need expertise in any
                        subject
                        to complete these summarization tasks. Finally, you must complete a survey about your experience
                        writing the summaries. Once the survey is complete, you can click "Submit" and you will be
                        redirected to Prolific.
                        On any page, this opening statement can be read by clicking the "?" button.

                    <p>
                        Please consider the following when completing this assignment:
                        <br><br>
                        Once you have completed a section, please do not go back to it. <b>Moving back to previous pages
                            may
                            introduce bugs that will risk the completion of your assignment.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        For the best experience, <b>please complete this survey in your browser's full screen mode.</b>

                        <b>You are allowed to use AI tools</b> (such as ChatGPT or similar) while completing this task.
                        That said,
                        the purpose of this study is to understand human reasoning and expression. For this reason,
                        answers written
                        mostly in your own words and ideas are much more valuable to us than answers that closely
                        resemble typical AI outputs.
                        <br><br>
                        After writing two summaries and fully completing the survey, you will be financially compensated
                        with a rate of 6£ per hour.

                    <h2>Consent and Participant Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        To the best of our abilities, your data will be stored securely. We will collect and store the
                        summaries you write, behavioral data that
                        is tracked as you write, and your Prolific ID. The only personally identifying information that
                        is stored will be your Prolific ID.
                        The Prolific ID is stored exclusively for the quality management of the collected data, and will
                        only be visible to the research team.
                        Data used for the Crowd Computing project will have the Prolific ID removed. The data will be
                        stored in a database provided by Render.com.

                For this page, we provide you an abstract for you to read. After reading the abstract, please summarize
                the abstract
                in the text box. Your summary should be 2-4 sentences in length. Once finished, click 'Next Page'. Note

                        The Asch conformity experiments, conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s, explored the impact of
                        social
                        pressure on individual beliefs and behaviors. In these experiments, groups of participants were
                        asked
                        to identify which of three lines matched the length of a reference line. Unbeknownst to the real
                        test
                        subject, the majority of the group consisted of actors who intentionally provided incorrect
                        answers.
                        Remarkably, about 36.8% of the actual participants conformed to the incorrect group consensus,
                        despite
                        knowing the answers were wrong. This finding highlighted the powerful influence of social
                        dynamics,
                        revealing that the desire for acceptance can lead individuals to prioritize group consensus over
                        their
                        own perceptions. The experiments are particularly significant in understanding group behavior
                        and have
                        been referenced in discussions about peer pressure, especially among children and adolescents.
                        Asch's
                        work has influenced subsequent psychological research, helping to illustrate the conditions
                        under which
                        conformity occurs and its potential implications in real-world situations, such as the dynamics
                        of group
                        decision-making.
