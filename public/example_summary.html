                            This paper reviews research on emotional influences on memory and judgement. First, it is found that when 
                            people are feeling happy, sad, or angry, they selectively attend to and learn more about stimulus material 
                            that is congruent with their feeling. Beyond selective attention, it is hypothesized that this congruity effect 
                            on learning arises because congruent material causes a more intense emotional reaction, and, within limits, 
                            people better remember events that are associated with more intense reactions. Second, it is found that emotion 
                            serves as a selective retrieval cue for material stored in memory in association with that emotion. People 
                            remember material best when they can reinstate the emotion they felt when it was learnt. Third, owing to this 
                            selective retrieval, emotion influences diverse cognitions and judgements: people’s fantasies, their impressions 
                            of others or themselves, their forecasts of the future, their predictions about their competencies, and so on.

                            Research shows that emotions significantly impact memory, cognition, and judgment. People tend to focus more on 
                            and retain information that aligns with their emotional state, particularly when the emotional reaction is strong. 
                            Emotions act as cues for selective memory retrieval, allowing individuals to recall experiences associated with 
                            similar feelings, thus influencing people’s fantasies, self-perceptions, judgments about others, and future predictions.
